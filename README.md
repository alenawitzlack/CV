I am a professor of [Linguisics at Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.linguistics.huji.ac.il/). Before coming to Jerusalem in 2018, I was an Assistant Professor (Juniorprofessorin) for typology and linguistic variance at the Department of General Linguistics at the University of Kiel. Before that I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Leipzig and at the University of Zurich.</p>

I received my PhD from the University of Leipzig in 2011. I wrote my thesis on Typological variation in grammatical relations with Balthasar Bickel and Johanna Nichols.</p>

* a co-edited volume with a state-of-the art overview of differential argument marking [Diachrony of differential argument marking](https://www.langsci-press.org/catalog/book/173) (2019, with Ilja A. Seržant)
* another co-edited volume on [Antipassive: typology, diachrony, and related constructions](https://benjamins.com/catalog/tsl.130) (2021)

### Language description and documentation
#### The Nsua of Semuliki Forest

#### So-called Khoisan
* I worked on two so-called Khoisan languages and on the typology of the Kalahari Basin Languages more generally.
* I am a co-depositor of the documentation collection [Text documentation of Nǀuu](https://www.elararchive.org/uncategorized/SO_6a3f1361-78ed-4830-b166-ec84c6c47da8/) (or Nǁng or ǂKhomani) at Endangered Languages Archive.

* Together with Saudah Namyalo (Makerere University) and a number of colleague, I worked on the documentation of the previously not described language [Ruuli](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ruul1235). We published [this grammar sketch and a dicitonary](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/326), as well as a number of papers on various topics of Ruuli morphosyntax.
