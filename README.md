* Together with Saudah Namyalo (Makerere University) and a number of colleague, I worked on the documentation of the previously not described language [Ruuli](https://www.elararchive.org/dk0089). We published [this grammar sketch and a dicitonary](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/326), as well as a number of papers on various topics of Ruuli morphosyntax.

I worked on two so-called Khoisan languages and on the typology of the Kalahari Basin Languages more generally.

We are working on the first papers from this project. We contributed a valency dataset to the [BiValTyp](https://www.bivaltyp.info/languages/descriptions/Khoekhoe.html) project.
